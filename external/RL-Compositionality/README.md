## 🧑‍🏫 Stage 1: Atomic Skill Acquisition

Stage 1 corresponds to rejection fine-tuning (RFT) on tasks where the function definitions are visible. The process produces a Stage 1 checkpoint that serves as the initialization for all Stage 2 experiments.

You can directly download our [Stage-1 RFT training data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/weizechen/RL-Compositionality-Stage1-RFT-Data) on 🤗Huggingface. 
```bash
hf download --repo-type dataset --local-dir data/string_task/stage1_level1/rft_data weizechen/RL-Compositionality-Stage1-RFT-Data
```

<details>
<summary>Alternatively, you can create the problems and collect the RFT data by yourself</summary>
  
1. **Generate synthetic training data**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section41_42/stage1_create_problems.sh
   ```

   This script populates `data/string_task/stage1_level1/` with train and test Parquet files containing atomic string transformations (the test Parquet is actually not used in the experiment).

2. **Collect rollouts & convert into RFT datasets**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section41_42/stage1_create_train_data.sh
   ```

   The script samples `N_SAMPLES` responses per prompt and stores them in `data/string_task/stage1_level1/rollout.parquet`. And then filters the rollouts based on the accuracy and emits `train.parquet` / `test.parquet` splits under `data/string_task/stage1_level1/rft_data/`.
</details>

Then train the `Llama 3.1 8B Instruct` model with the RFT data:
```bash
bash bash/section41_42/stage1_rft.sh
```

The resulting checkpoint is saved to `checkpoints/string-task/stage1-rft/` and initializes every Stage 2 run.

## 🧩 Stage 2: Learning Compositional Skills

Stage 2 removes access to function implementations and focuses on compositional reasoning. **All scripts assume that `bash/section41_42/stage1_rft.sh` has been executed successfully.**


### 🤖 RL Variants (Sections 4.1 & 4.2)

Download the RL training and evaluation dataset from 🤗Huggingface

```bash
# Training
hf download --repo-type dataset --local-dir data/string_task/stage2_level1 weizechen/RL-Compositionality-Stage2-RL-Level1-TrainData
hf download --repo-type dataset --local-dir data/string_task/stage2_level2 weizechen/RL-Compositionality-Stage2-RL-Level2-TrainData

# Evaluation
hf download --repo-type dataset --local-dir data/string_task/stage2_level1to8 weizechen/RL-Compositionality-Stage2-RL-Level2-TestData
```

<details>
<summary>Alternatively, you can create the problems yourself</summary>

   ```bash
   bash bash/section41_42/stage2_create_problems.sh
   ```

   ➡️ Generates Level-1, Level-2 training splits and a Level-1-to-8 evaluation split.

</details>

Launch RL training with your desired setting:

```bash
bash bash/section41_42/stage2_rl_level1.sh      # Level-1 only
bash bash/section41_42/stage2_rl_level2.sh      # Level-2 only
bash bash/section41_42/stage2_rl_level1to2.sh   # Mixed Level-1+2
```

### 📊 RFT Baseline (Section 4.2)

To compare RL with supervised rejection fine-tuning:

1. **Partition Level-2 data into iterative RFT chunks**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section41_42/stage2_rft_create_problems.sh
   ```

2. **Collect rollouts & convert them into RFT datasets**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section41_42/stage2_rft_create_train_data.sh
   ```

3. **Fine-tune with Stage 1 checkpoint**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section41_42/stage2_rft_train.sh
   ```

4. **Iterative RFT** 🔁
   Repeat steps 2–3 with updated model/data paths.

## 🔀 Cross-Task Transfer to Countdown (Section 4.3)

1. **Generate Countdown arithmetic datasets** 

   ```bash
   bash bash/section43/create_countdown_data.sh
   ```

2. **Collect rollouts & convert to RFT data**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section43/stage1_collect_train_data.sh
   ```

   The script will collect model's rollout on Countdown Level 2 problems, filter according to the accuracy, merge them with string task RFT data, and save to `data/string_countdown_task/stage1_rft_data/`

3. **Train the model** 🏋️
   You can reuse the script from `bash/section41_42/stage1_rft.sh`, and change the data path to `data/string_countdown_task/stage1_rft_data`.

The Stage 2 training is the same as Section 4.1/4.2. You can reuse the scripts and change the model path.

---

## 📈 Pass@k Analysis (Sections 4.4)

1. **1000 Rollout Collection**

   ```bash
   bash bash/section44/passk.sh
   ```

   This command samples completions from a trained policy, saves them to `results/stage2_rl_level1/all.parquet`, and enables downstream computation of pass@k metrics. Change the model path to obtain the 1000 responses from other models.
